## A2 - Car Price Prediction with customized code for linear regression model

## Brief Introduction about this project

In this repository, I developed a model to predict car prices for the Chaky Company. The dataset I utilized was the 'Cars.csv' dataset. I performed various data preparation steps such as data cleaning and label encoding, among others. You can find detailed information about the steps I took in my Jupyter notebook, which I highly recommend reading.

## Quick start

To explore this project, you'll need Docker or a compiler that can interpret Jupyter notebooks, along with an IDE like VScode.

In this project, I do a lot of expirements using cross validation of different hyper parameters for my modelling part. I use MSE and r2score to compare among the models.
I admit here that my model has some bug,so the results of MSE and r2scores are not good.

I deployed my model to allow easy access and testing.

To compare the models I use ML flow.

### About Deployment and Flask:
For deployment, I deploy the model on website.

## Conclusion:
I summarized the outcomes of these experiments at the end of the my Jupyter notebook.

Thank you for your interest in my project.
